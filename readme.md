Remember this when Naming and Using Variables !!

Variable names can contain only:
- lettters
- numbers
- underscores
They can start with a letter or underscore, but not with a number

Spaces are not allowed in variable names, but underscores can be used to separate words in variable names

Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names

Variable names should be short but descriptive

Be careful when using the lowercase l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0

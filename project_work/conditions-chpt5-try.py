# TRY IT YOURSELF


# 5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
# describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
# should look something like this:
# car = 'subaru'
# print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
# print(car == 'subaru')
# print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
# print(car == 'audi')
# • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line
# evaluates to True or False.
# • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another
# 5 tests evaluate to False.

pizza = 'cheese'
print("Is pizza == 'cheese'? I predict True " )
print(pizza == 'cheese' )

pizza = 'pineapple'
print("\nIs pizza == 'anchovies'? I predict False " )
print(pizza == 'anchovies')


pizza = 'chicken'
print("\nIs pizza == 'chicken'? I predict True " )
print(pizza == 'chicken')

pizza = 'veggie'
print("\nIs pizza == 'cheese'? I predict False " )
print(pizza == 'cheese')

pizza = 'double cheese'
print("\nIs pizza == 'double cheese'? I predict True " )
print(pizza == 'double cheese')

city = 'atlanta'


# 5-2. More Conditional Tests: You don’t have to limit the number of tests you create
# to 10. If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests and add them
# to conditional_tests.py. Have at least one True and one False result for each of
# the following:
# • Tests for equality and inequality with strings
# • Tests using the lower() method
# • Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less
# than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to
# • Tests using the and keyword and the or keyword
# • Test whether an item is in a list
# • Test whether an item is not in a list
